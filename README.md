Optimized Diet Plan (2 PM - 10 PM Eating Window)

💪 Meal 1 (2 PM – Post-Fast Meal)

🔹 High Protein + Healthy Carbs

Whey protein shake (with water or milk)

2 boiled eggs

1 small bowl of curd with 1 tbsp muesli + 5-6 almonds & 2 walnuts


⏩ Why? Fast digestion after fasting, protein kickstart, energy from muesli & nuts


---

🏋️‍♂️ Pre-Workout (If You Train Before Dinner)

🔹 Quick Carbs + Protein

1 banana or 2 dates

Handful of peanuts


⏩ Why? Energy for workout, prevents muscle breakdown


---

🥗 Meal 2 (6-7 PM – Main Meal)

🔹 High Protein + Fiber-Rich Carbs

2 roti OR 1.5 cups cooked rice

2 cups dal (toor/moong/masoor mix for better protein)

200g veggies (bhindi, spinach, etc., cooked with 1 tsp ghee)

Curd (small bowl) with ½ tsp roasted jeera


⏩ Why? Balanced meal with protein, carbs, and fiber, supports recovery


---

🥜 Meal 3 (9-10 PM – Light Meal Before Fast Starts)

🔹 Protein + Healthy Fats (No Heavy Carbs at Night)

1 boiled egg

Handful of almonds & walnuts

Whey with water (if protein is low for the day)


⏩ Why? Supports overnight metabolism, prevents muscle loss


---

💡 Adjustments & Tips:

✅ If weight loss is slow, reduce roti to 1 or cut muesli to 1 tbsp
✅ If energy is low, increase dal quantity or add 1 more egg
✅ Drink 2-3 liters of water daily

This plan ensures high protein (~140-160g) while keeping calories in check. Let me know if you need any changes!
